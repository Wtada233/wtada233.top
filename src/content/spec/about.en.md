# About Me

I am **Wtada233**, more commonly known online as **Linuxfirmware**.

I enjoy tinkering with Arch Linux and consider myself an amateur "tech porter." I don't produce spaghetti code; I just relocate it 😀.

- **Interests**: Linux, Minecraft, Genshin Impact, Frontend Engineering
- **Skills**: TypeScript, Astro, various eccentric Linux optimization methods

# About This Blog

This is a heavily modded derivative of [Fuwari](https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari).

Rather than just a blog, it's an **Extreme Staticization Project**. I use this space not only to document my life but to test how to build a digital environment that can withstand the erosion of time, ignore service outages, and possess strong "offline survival capabilities."

### Core Features
- **Fully Automated Pipeline**: Config validation based on Zod, dominant color extraction using Sharp.
- **Digital Heritage Protection**: Automated GitHub staticization and external image localization scripts.
- **Extreme Performance**: Automatic font subsetting/compression, zero CDN dependency.
